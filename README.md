# figwheel-atom-editor-starter

This is a now-moth-balled attempt at setting up the atom-editor for clojurescript
development using figwheel.

## Overview

Too early to use as the best REPL package for the atom editor
[proto-repl](https://github.com/jasongilman/proto-repl) mangles the cljs REPL
somehow. There are people thinking about it at jasongilman/proto-repl#54.

## Setup

... not yet.
